# Cocktail Builder 서버 설치

MacOS에서 VirtualBox를 이용하여 Cocktail이 제공하는 기능을 간단하게 확인하고자 할 경우에 아래의 절차를 따라 설치한다.

1.Docker를 설치한다. Centos 기준임.

```
# sudo su -
# yum install -y yum-utils
# yum-config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo
# yum makecache fast
# yum install docker-ce
# systemctl start docker
```

2.Docker-Compose 설치

    # sudo su -
    # mkdir software
    # cd software
    # curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.12.0/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` > docker-compose
    # chmod +x docker-compose
    # mv docker-compose /usr/local/bin/
    # docker-compose --version

3.Harbor 설치

```
# sudo su -
# cd ~/software
# wget https://github.com/vmware/harbor/releases/download/v1.1.1-rc4/harbor-online-installer-v1.1.1-rc4.tgz
# tar -xvf harbor-online-installer-v1.1.1-rc4.tgz
# cd harbor
```
